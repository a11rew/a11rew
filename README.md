### 👋 Hi!

I'm here a lot, maybe too much, connecting dots that may or may not form coherent pictures. 

I'm unreasonably optimistic about, and deeply invested in: 
- Everything web: The [web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform) is underrated as an application runtime. 
- Personal, [local-first](https://www.localfirst.fm/landscape) software, and the death of the loading spinner. 
- Probabilistic word generators _and/as_ [machines of loving grace](https://darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace).

#### What I'm working on

- [Budge AI](https://trybudge.ai) - Teaching LLMs to be useful for personal finance. Track spending across mobile money and banks without logins.
 _Because personal finance software peaked in 2009 and only understood one kind of banking._
- [medusa-payment-paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack) - Collect payments in your Medusa store with Paystack.
- [a11rew.dev](https://a11rew.dev) - My corner of the internet. And no, it is not a numeronym.
